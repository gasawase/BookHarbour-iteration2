TODO:
- detection of location on bookshelf
- calculate location on shelf
- remove book from list when placed on shelf
- register book on a specific location on bookshelf
- parser that parses base64 into images

Do later
- variable heights of books
- get image and cut down to spine size and cover size
- refine differentiating between 3D and 2D objects (currently complicated validation process with lots of conditionals)
